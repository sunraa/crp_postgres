# CRP_Postgres

This repo contains sql files for the creation of all tables available through the [Center for Responsive Politics Bulk Data] download. They provide a user guide which has some basic table definitions but not in Postgres format. I took the liberty of re-creating them so I could use them in PostgreSQL.
